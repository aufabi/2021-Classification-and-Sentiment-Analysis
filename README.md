# Classification and Sentiment Analysis
In this project, I do a web scrapping to get some tweets related to PPKM during covid. 
After the data was cleaned, I classified the tweet into positive and negative sentiment by calculating the sum of positive words and negative words.
I attempted to implement TfidfVectorizer to vectorize each words which then I applied the GaussianNB as a model to predict the sentiment.
I also created a topic extraction by using Lda model.
